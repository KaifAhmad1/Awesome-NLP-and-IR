## NLP 
### **NLP Preprocessing**
 - **Case Folding:**   Case folding is a preprocessing technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that standardizes the text by converting all characters to a single case, typically lowercase. This step is essential for various NLP tasks as it ensures uniformity and consistency in text data, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream applications.
   - **For Example**
      - `Artificial Intelligence` becomes `artificial intelligence`
      - `Data Science` becomes `data science`
