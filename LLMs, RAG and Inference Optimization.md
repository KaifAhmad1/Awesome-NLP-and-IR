# LLMs
## **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These models are designed to understand and generate human language by leveraging deep learning techniques and vast amounts of data. Unlike simpler models, LLMs can perform a wide range of tasks, from translation and summarization to answering questions and engaging in conversational dialogues.

---

 - ### **Architecture:**
The architecture of LLMs is typically based on the Transformer model, which was introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 in the paper "Attention is All You Need". The key components of this architecture are:
  - #### 1. **Self-Attention Mechanism:** 
    This allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and relationships within the text.
  - #### 2. **Multi-Head Attention:** 
    Multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, enhancing its ability to understand context.
  - #### 3. **Feed-forward Neural Networks:** 
    These are applied to each position in the sequence independently, adding a layer of non-linearity.
  - #### 4. **Positional Encoding:** 
    Since Transformers do not inherently capture the order of the sequence, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each word in the sequence.

 - ### **Training:**
LLMs are trained using large datasets that encompass a diverse range of text sources, such as books, articles, websites, and more. The training process involves:
  - #### **Pre-training:**
    The model is trained on a large corpus of text to learn language patterns. This is typically done in an unsupervised manner, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence or fill in the blanks.
  - #### **Fine-tuning:**
    The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset to improve its performance on particular tasks, such as question answering or text summarization.
 - #### **Advantages:**
    - **Versatility:** LLMs can handle a wide variety of tasks without the need for task-specific architectures.
    - **Contextual Understanding:** Their ability to capture long-range dependencies makes them adept at understanding context.
    - **Scalability:** They can be scaled to larger datasets and more parameters, leading to improved performance.
  - #### **Limitations:**
    - **Computationally Intensive:** Training and deploying LLMs require significant computational resources, including powerful GPUs and extensive memory.
    - **Data Hungry:** They need vast amounts of training data to achieve high performance.
    - **Bias and Fairness:** LLMs can inadvertently learn and propagate biases present in the training data, leading to ethical concerns.
    - **Interpretability:** Their large and complex architectures make it difficult to understand and interpret their decision-making processes.
---
   ### **LLM Pretraining** 
  Pretraining is the process of training a machine learning model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it on a specific task. This initial phase involves learning general patterns, representations, and features from the data, which can then be adapted and refined for various downstream tasks, improving performance and efficiency.
- #### **Self Supervised Learning:**
  - Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a cutting-edge approach in machine learning where the model trains itself using automatically generated labels derived from the data, eliminating the need for manual annotation. This method harnesses the abundance of unlabeled data, which is both plentiful and inexpensive, to build robust and powerful models.
  - SSL is considered a subset of unsupervised learning, where the data itself provides the necessary supervision. The model is trained to predict one part of the input data from another part, allowing it to learn meaningful patterns and representations. This approach is particularly beneficial for training large language models (LLMs) because it enables them to extract rich and diverse features from vast amounts of text data without requiring human-labeled examples.
  - #### Key Concepts
    - **Pretext Task:** The core idea of SSL is to create a pretext task, a pseudo-task for which labels can be generated from the data itself. The model is first trained on this task, and the learned representations are then fine-tuned on the actual downstream task.
    - **Downstream Task:** After learning representations from the pretext task, the model is fine-tuned or directly applied to the downstream task, which is the actual task of interest (e.g., image classification, object detection, natural language understanding).
      
- #### **Key Techniques in Self-Supervised Learning**
    - Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Multimodal Language Modeling (MMLM)
    - Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
    - Causal Language Modeling (CLM)
    - Denoising Autoencoders
    - Contrastive Learning
 ---
 - ### **Masked Language Modeling:**
     - In MLM, certain tokens in the input sequence are masked at random, and the model is trained to predict these masked tokens based on the context provided by the remaining tokens.
     - This approach helps the model understand bidirectional contexts.
- #### **Mathematical Formulation**
  - Given a sequence of tokens $\mathbf{X} = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$, we create a corrupted version $\mathbf{X}_{\text{masked}}$ by replacing some tokens with a special `[MASK]` token.
  - Let $M$ be the set of masked positions.
  - The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of the masked tokens given the context:
  
    $$L_{\text{MLM}} = -\sum_{i \in M} \log P(x_i \mid \mathbf{X}_{\text{masked}})$$
    
  - Here, $P(x_i \mid \mathbf{X}_{\text{masked}})$ is the probability of token $x_i$ given the masked sequence.

 In MLM, the model enhances its understanding of bidirectional contexts by predicting masked tokens.

---
- ### **Masked Multimodal Language Modeling:**
    - In MMLM, certain tokens in the input sequence are masked at random, similar to MLM, but the model is trained using both textual and non-textual data such as images, audio, or video.
    - This approach enhances the model's ability to understand and integrate multimodal information, learning representations that capture the interplay between different modalities.

- #### **Mathematical Formulation**
  - Given a sequence of tokens $\mathbf{X} = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ and a sequence of non-textual features $\mathbf{Y} = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m\}$, we create a corrupted version $\mathbf{X}_{\text{masked}}$ by replacing some tokens with a special `[MASK]` token.
  - Let $M$ be the set of masked positions in $\mathbf{X}$.
  - The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of the masked tokens given the context provided by both the masked textual sequence and the associated non-textual data:

    $$L_{\text{MMLM}} = -\sum_{i \in M} \log P(x_i \mid \mathbf{X}_{\text{masked}}, \mathbf{Y})$$
    
  - Here, $P(x_i \mid \mathbf{X}_{\text{masked}}, \mathbf{Y})$ is the probability of token $x_i` given the masked sequence and the additional multimodal context.

By integrating information from multiple modalities, MMLM allows models to learn richer, more comprehensive representations, leading to improvements in tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and more complex language understanding scenarios where context is derived from both text and other types of data.

---     

- ### **Next Sentence Prediction:**
    - In NSP, the model is trained to understand the relationship between pairs of sentences, determining whether a given sentence B naturally follows a given sentence A.
    - This technique is particularly useful for tasks that require a coherent understanding of longer texts, such as document-level question answering and summarization.

- #### **Mathematical Formulation**
  - Given a pair of sentences $(A, B)$, the model's task is to predict whether $B$ is the actual next sentence that follows $A$ in the corpus.
  - We introduce a binary classification variable $y \in \{0, 1\}$, where $y = 1$ indicates that $B$ is the next sentence following $A$, and $y = 0$ otherwise.
  - The training objective is to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss:

    $$L_{\text{NSP}} = -\left[ y \log P(y=1 \mid A, B) + (1 - y) \log P(y=0 \mid A, B) \right]$$
    
  - Here, $P(y=1 \mid A, B)$ is the probability that $B$ is the next sentence following $A$.

Training on NSP tasks, the model learns to capture sentence-level coherence and dependencies, enhancing its ability to perform tasks that require understanding the flow of information across multiple sentences crucial for tasks like document-level QA and summarization.

--- 

- ### **Causal Language Modeling:**
    - In CLM, the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence, given all the previous tokens. This unidirectional approach models the probability of a token based on its preceding context.
    - This technique is particularly effective for tasks that require generative capabilities, such as text generation and language modeling.

- #### **Mathematical Formulation**
  - Given a sequence of tokens $\mathbf{X} = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$, the model is trained to predict each token $x_t$ based on the preceding tokens $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1}\}$.
  - The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of each token in the sequence:

    $$L_{\text{CLM}} = -\sum_{t=1}^{n} \log P(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1})$$
    
  - Here, $P(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1})$ is the probability of token $x_t$ given the preceding tokens.

CLM focuses on generating coherent text by predicting tokens based on their sequential context, making it ideal for generative tasks.

--- 

 ### **Denoising Autoencoders:**
   - Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) are trained to reconstruct the original input from a corrupted version of it. This process helps the model learn robust representations by focusing on essential features and ignoring noise.
   - This technique is widely used for tasks such as feature learning, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

- #### **Mathematical Formulation**
  - Given an input sequence $\mathbf{X} = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$, we create a corrupted version $\mathbf{X}_{\text{corrupted}}$ by applying noise or perturbations.
  - The model is trained to reconstruct the original input sequence $\mathbf{X}$ from the corrupted version $\mathbf{X}_{\text{corrupted}}$.
  - The training objective is to minimize the reconstruction loss, often measured by mean squared error (MSE) or cross-entropy loss, depending on the nature of the data:

    $$L_{\text{DAE}} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \| x_t - \hat{x}_t \|^2$$
    
  - Here, $\hat{x}_t$ is the reconstructed token corresponding to the original token $x_t$.

DAE improves model robustness by reconstructing clean inputs from corrupted versions, essential for tasks requiring accurate data representation.

--- 

- ### **Contrastive Learning:**
    - Contrastive Learning trains the model to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of data. By learning to bring similar pairs closer and push dissimilar pairs apart in the representation space, the model captures meaningful patterns and structures in the data.
    - This technique is particularly effective for tasks such as image and text clustering, and representation learning.

- #### **Mathematical Formulation**
  - Given a set of input pairs $\{(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_i^+), (\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_i^-)\}$ where $(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_i^+)$ are similar pairs and $(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_i^-)$ are dissimilar pairs, the model learns to minimize the distance between similar pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs.
  - The training objective is to minimize the contrastive loss, which can be defined as:

    $$L_{\text{contrastive}} = \sum_{i} \left[ \max(0, d(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_i^+) - d(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_i^-) + \alpha) \right]$$
    
  - Here, $d(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j)$ is the distance measure (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the representations of $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$, and $\alpha$ is a margin that enforces a minimum separation between dissimilar pairs.

This technique enhances model performance by learning discriminative features from data pairs, beneficial for tasks like image and text clustering, retrieval.

   ### **LLM Fine Tuning** 
   Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained language model to specific downstream tasks by further training it on task-specific data. While pre-training provides a strong foundation by learning general language patterns, fine-tuning tailors the model to excel in particular applications, improving its performance on specific tasks.
   - #### **Why We Need Fine-Tuning:**
     - **Task Specialization:** Pre-trained models are generalists. Fine-tuning allows these models to specialize in particular tasks such as sentiment analysis, translation, or question answering.
     - **Improved Performance:** Fine-tuning on task-specific data enhances the model's ability to perform well on that task by leveraging the relevant information it has seen during pretraining.
     - **Efficiency:** Fine-tuning requires significantly less data and computational resources compared to training a model from scratch, making it a practical approach for many applications.
### Supervised Fine-Tuning

Supervised fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained model to a specific task using labeled data, refining the general knowledge the model gained during pre-training for particular applications.

#### Steps in Supervised Fine-Tuning

1. **Pre-trained Model Selection:**
   - Choose a model pre-trained on a large dataset (e.g., BERT, GPT, ResNet).

2. **Task-Specific Dataset:**
   - Prepare a labeled dataset relevant to the task (e.g., sentiment analysis, image classification).

3. **Model Adjustment (Optional):**
   - Modify the model architecture if necessary (e.g., add task-specific layers).

4. **Training Process:**
   - **Initialization:** Load pre-trained weights.
   - **Loss Function:** Choose a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification):
     $$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$$
   - **Optimizer:** Select an optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD).

5. **Training Loop:**
   - Train the model, including forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter updates:
     $$\theta = \theta - \eta \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}$$
     where $\theta$ represents model parameters and $\eta$ is the learning rate.

6. **Evaluation and Validation:**
   - Monitor performance on a validation set using metrics like accuracy or F1 score to avoid overfitting.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Adjust learning rate, batch size, and epochs to optimize performance.

8. **Testing:**
   - Test the fine-tuned model on an unseen test set to assess generalization.

#### Advantages

- **Improved Performance:** Enhances accuracy by specializing the model for specific tasks.
- **Efficiency:** Requires less data and computational resources than training from scratch.
- **Flexibility:** Allows the same model to be fine-tuned for various tasks.

    
- ### **Types of Fine-Tuning Methods**
    - Full Fine-Tuning
    - Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
    - Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT)
    - Alignment-Based Fine-Tuning

  ---
 ### Full Fine-Tuning

Full fine-tuning involves adjusting all parts of a pre-trained model $\theta$ to fit a new task-specific dataset. Here’s how it works:

#### How It Works:

1. **Starting Point**: You begin with a pre-trained model $\theta$, which has already learned useful patterns from a large dataset during its initial training.

2. **New Task**: You have a new dataset $\mathcal{D}$ for a specific task, such as recognizing objects in images or understanding sentiment in text.

3. **Adjusting the Model**: The goal is to make $\theta$ better at the new task by updating all its parameters based on $\mathcal{D}$. This is done by minimizing a measure of how well the model predicts on $\mathcal{D}$, known as the loss function $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$.

   - **Loss Function**: This function $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ tells us how wrong the model's predictions are compared to the correct answers in `$\mathcal{D}$`.
   
     $$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(\theta; x_i, y_i)$$
   
     Here, $\ell(\theta; x_i, y_i)$ quantifies the error between the model's prediction and the true label $y_i$ for input $x_i$.

   - **Optimization**: Techniques like gradient descent are used to adjust $\theta$ to minimize $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$. This means tweaking $\theta$ in small steps to improve its performance on the new task.

#### Advantages:

- **Efficiency**: It builds on what the model already knows, saving time compared to training from scratch.
- **Performance**: Can lead to better results on the new task because the model starts with a strong foundation.

#### Challenges, including Catastrophic Forgetting:

- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: While adjusting to the new dataset, the model might forget some things it learned from its original training. This can lead to poorer performance on tasks it used to handle well.
  
- **Balancing Act**: It's important to find a balance between adapting to the new data and retaining valuable knowledge from previous training.

--- 

 ### PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):
 PEFT is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in deep learning and LLMs, where instead of updating all parameters of a pre-trained model during adaptation to a new task or dataset, only a subset of parameters are adjusted. This approach aims to optimize model performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning methods.
- #### **Why PEFT is Needed:**
PEFT addresses key challenges and practical considerations in machine learning:
   - **Efficiency:** It reduces computational resources and time required for training by updating only the most relevant parameters, making it feasible to deploy models on hardware with limited capabilities.
   - **Preservation of Knowledge:** PEFT retains valuable knowledge from pre-training, minimizing changes to the original model architecture while adapting it to new tasks.
   - **Generalization:** By focusing updates on task-relevant parameters, PEFT can improve model generalization on new datasets by avoiding overfitting.
- #### **Advantages of PEFT over Full Fine-Tuning:**
   - **Speed:** Faster convergence during training due to fewer parameters being updated.
   - **Resource Efficiency:** Reduced memory and computational demands, suitable for deployment on hardware with constraints.
   - **Flexibility:** Adaptable to various deep learning architectures and scales, including large models with millions or billions of parameters.
   - **Improved Performance:** Enhanced model efficiency and effectiveness on new tasks, leveraging pre-trained knowledge effectively.
- #### **Types of PEFT**
  - Additive PEFT
  - Selective PEFT
  - Reparameterized PEFT
  - Hybrid PEFT
    
---

  - ### **Additive PEFT**
    Full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models (PLMs) is computationally expensive and can potentially harm their generalization ability. To address this, a common approach is to leave the pre-trained model largely unchanged and introduce a minimal number of trainable parameters. These additional parameters are strategically positioned within the model architecture, and only these weights are updated during fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. This approach, called Additive Tuning, significantly reduces storage, memory, and computational resource requirements.
    1. #### **Adapters**
       Adapter methods involve inserting small adapter layers within Transformer blocks. These layers typically consist of a down-projection matrix $W_{\text{down}}$, a non-linear activation function $\sigma$, and an up-projection matrix $W_{\text{up}}$. Given an input $h_{\text{in}}$, the computation in the adapter module (with residual connection) is:

       $$\text{Adapter}(x) = W_{\text{up}} \sigma (W_{\text{down}} x) + x$$

       #### Adapter Variants
       1. #### **Serial Adapter**
          Each Transformer block is enhanced with adapter modules placed after the self-attention layer and the feed-forward network (FFN) layer.
       2. #### **Parallel Adapter**
          Adapter layers run alongside each Transformer sublayer, maintaining model parallelism and efficiency.
       3. #### **CoDA**
          Combines parallel adapters with a sparse activation mechanism, where a soft top-k selection process identifies important tokens processed by both the frozen pre-trained layer and the adapter branch for efficiency.
    2. #### **Soft Prompt-based Fine-tuning**
       Soft prompt-based fine-tuning refines model performance by optimizing continuous vectors, known as soft prompts, appended to the input sequence. This approach leverages the rich information contained within the continuous embedding space, as opposed to discrete token representations.

       #### Prominent Soft Prompt Approaches:
       - **Prefix-tuning:** Introduced by [35], this method adds learnable vectors to keys and values across all Transformer layers. A reparameterization strategy using an MLP layer ensures stable optimization. Variants such as p-tuning v2 [37] and APT (Adaptive Prefix Tuning) [38] have enhanced this method by removing reparameterization and introducing adaptive mechanisms to control the importance of prefixes in each layer.
    3. #### **Other Additive Methods**
       Several other methods incorporate additional parameters during fine-tuning, aiming to enhance efficiency without modifying the base model’s structure significantly.

       **(IA)^3:** (IA)^3 [53] introduces three learnable rescaling vectors (for key, value, and FFN activations) to scale the activations within the Transformer layers. This integration, shown in Figure 6(a), eliminates extra computational costs during inference.

---

- ### **Selective PEFT**
  Selective PEFT methods focus on fine-tuning a subset of existing parameters rather than introducing additional parameters. This approach aims to enhance model performance on specific downstream tasks while minimizing computational overhead. Selective PEFT can be broadly categorized into unstructured and structured masking techniques.

  - #### **Unstructured Masking**
    Unstructured masking involves applying binary masks to the model's parameters to determine which ones are updated during fine-tuning. The binary mask **M = { m_i }** indicates whether a parameter **θ_i** is frozen (0) or trainable (1). The updated parameters after fine-tuning are calculated as:
    
    $$θ_i' = θ_i - η \cdot BL_{θ_i} \cdot m_i$$
    
    where η is the learning rate, $BL_{θ_i}$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to $θ_i$. This selective updating process optimizes resource allocation by focusing computational efforts on task-critical parameters.

    Representative methods in unstructured masking include:
    
    - **Diff Pruning**: Uses a differentiable L0-norm penalty to regularize a learnable binary mask applied to model weights.
    - **PaFi (Parameter-Freezing)**: Selects parameters with the smallest absolute magnitude for fine-tuning, optimizing parameter efficiency.
    - **FishMask**: Uses Fisher information to determine parameter importance, selecting top parameters for updating based on task relevance.
    - **Fish-Dip**: Dynamically recalculates the mask using Fisher information during each training period to adapt to evolving task requirements.
    - **Child-tuning**: Introduces dynamic selection of a `child` network during training iterations, where only parameters within the chosen network are updated.

  - #### **Structured Masking**
    Structured masking organizes parameter selection into regular patterns rather than applying it randomly, enhancing computational and hardware efficiency during training.
    
    Techniques in structured selective PEFT include:
    
    - **Structured Pruning**: Techniques like Diff Pruning partition weight parameters into local groups and systematically prune them based on predefined criteria, improving computational efficiency.
    - **FAR (Feature-Aware Regularization)**: Groups FFN weights in Transformer blocks into nodes, ranks them using L1 norm, and fine-tunes only the most critical nodes for selective optimization.
    - **Bitfit**: Focuses on fine-tuning bias parameters of DNN layers, demonstrating competitive results for smaller models.
    - **Xattn Tuning (Cross-Attention Tuning)**: Fine-tunes only cross-attention layers within Transformer architectures, optimizing model adaptation for specific tasks.
    - **SPT (Sensitivity-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**: Identifies sensitive parameters through first-order Taylor expansions, selecting and fine-tuning only those critical for task performance.

- ### **Background of Matrix Decomposition**
  Matrix decomposition, also known as factorization, breaks down matrices into simpler components, essential across mathematics, engineering, and data science for simplifying operations and revealing underlying structures.
  
  - #### **Why Matrix Decomposition is Essential:**
    1. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Simplifies data/models by retaining key information in lower-dimensional forms, reducing complexity and storage needs.
    2. **Feature Extraction:** Identifies data patterns/features crucial in analysis and machine learning, enhancing efficiency in processing and interpretation.
    3. **Numerical Stability:** Enhances stability in computations, particularly for large or ill-conditioned matrices, by reducing errors through decomposition.
    4. **Algorithm Efficiency:** Speeds up operations and reduces memory usage compared to original matrices, crucial in fields like image/signal processing.
  
  - #### **Advantages:**
    - **Simplicity and Interpretability:** Simplifies relationships within data/models (e.g., PCA's eigen-decomposition).
    - **Computational Efficiency:** Faster operations and lower memory use post-decomposition, vital for large datasets/models.
    - **Optimization Applications:** Crucial in solving linear equations and iterative algorithms (e.g., SVD in recommendations).
    - **Flexibility:** Various methods (e.g., SVD, QR, LU) cater to different challenges, adaptable to diverse applications.
    - **Feature Transformation:** Enhances feature representation, e.g., in deep learning, via matrix transformations.

### **Reparameterized PEFT**

#### **LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation**

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a widely recognized reparameterization technique.

- **Concept:**
  - For a given pre-trained weight matrix $W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, LoRA introduces two trainable weight matrices:
    - $W_{up} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$
    - $W_{down} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$
  - Here, the rank $r \leq \min(d, k)$.
  - These matrices operate in parallel to $W_0$.

- **Operation:**
  - The input $h_{\text{in}}$ typically produces the output $h_{\text{out}} = W_0 h_{\text{in}}$.
  - LoRA modifies this output by introducing an incremental update $\Delta W$:

    $$h_{\text{out}} = W_0 h_{\text{in}} + \frac{\alpha}{r} W_{up} W_{down} h_{\text{in}}$$

    where $\alpha$ is a scaling factor.

- **Implementation:**
  - Initially, $W_{down}$ is randomized, and $W_{up}$ is zeroed out, ensuring $\Delta W$ starts at zero.
  - LoRA is straightforward to implement and effective on models with up to 175 billion parameters.
  - Once fine-tuning is complete, LoRA’s adaptive weights integrate seamlessly with the pre-trained backbone, maintaining efficiency without adding inference burden.

#### **DyLoRA: Dynamic LoRA**

DyLoRA addresses the challenge of selecting an appropriate rank in LoRA training.

- **Concept:**
  - DyLoRA trains the LoRA module on a range of ranks within a predefined training budget.
  - For a given rank range, DyLoRA dynamically chooses a rank at each iteration.

- **Operation:**
  - Matrices $W_{down}$ and $W_{up}$ are tailored for the selected rank, reducing the training time required to find an optimal rank.

#### **AdaLoRA: Adaptive LoRA**

AdaLoRA reformulates $\Delta W$ with a singular value decomposition (SVD).

- **Concept:**
  - $\Delta W = P \Lambda Q$, where:
    - $P$ and $Q$ are orthogonal matrices.
    - $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values.

- **Operation:**
  - Singular values are pruned iteratively during training based on their importance scores.
  - An additional regularizer term is included in the loss to ensure orthogonality:

    $$R(P, Q) = \| P^T P - I \|^2_F + \| QQ^T - I \|^2_F$$

- **Advantages:**
  - This approach allows the model to dynamically adjust the rank within each LoRA module, effectively managing its parameter counts.
  - AdaLoRA delivers superior performance by leveraging a predefined training budget for pruning, orthogonality maintenance, and learning module-specific ranks dynamically.

### **Hybrid PEFT**

The effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods varies across tasks. Thus, many studies focus on combining the advantages of different PEFT approaches or unifying them through commonalities. Here are some notable approaches:

#### **1. UniPELT**

UniPELT integrates LoRA, prefix-tuning, and adapters within each Transformer block, using a gating mechanism to control the activation of PEFT submodules. This mechanism consists of three small feed-forward networks (FFNs), each producing a scalar value $G \in [0,1]$, applied to LoRA, prefix, and adapter matrices respectively. UniPELT consistently improves accuracy by 1% to 4% across various setups.

#### **2. S4**

S4 explores design spaces for Adapter (A), Prefix (P), BitFit (B), and LoRA (L), identifying key design patterns:

- **Spindle Grouping**: Divides Transformer layers into four groups $G_i$ for $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$, with each group applying similar PEFT strategies.
- **Uniform Parameter Allocation**: Distributes trainable parameters uniformly across layers.
- **Tuning All Groups**: Ensures all groups are tuned.
- **Diverse Strategies per Group**: Assigns different PEFT strategies to different groups. Optimal configuration:
  - $G_1$: (A, L)
  - $G_2$: (A, P)
  - $G_3$: (A, P, B)
  - $G_4$: (P, B, L)

#### **3. MAM Adapter**

MAM Adapter examines the similarities between adapters, prefix-tuning, and LoRA, creating three variants:

- **Parallel Adapter**: Places adapter layers alongside specific layers (SA or FFN).
- **Multi-head Parallel Adapter**: Divides the parallel adapter into multiple heads affecting head attention output in SA.
- **Scaled Parallel Adapter**: Adds a scaling term post-adapter layer, akin to LoRA.

The best setup, called the MAM Adapter, uses prefix-tuning in the SA layer and a scaled parallel adapter in the FFN layer.

#### **4. LLM-Adapters**

LLM-Adapters offer a framework incorporating various PEFT techniques into large language models (LLMs). Key insights include:

- Effective placements for series adapters, parallel adapters, and LoRA are after MLP layers, alongside MLP layers, and following both Attention and MLP layers, respectively.
- Smaller LLMs with PEFT can match or surpass larger models on certain tasks.
- Proper in-distribution fine-tuning enables smaller models to outperform larger ones on specific tasks.

#### **5. Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**

NAS is used to discover optimal PEFT combinations:
- **NOAH:** Uses NAS to find the best PEFT configurations for each dataset, employing AutoFormer, a one-shot NAS algorithm. The search space includes Adapter, LoRA, and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT).
- **AUTOPEFT:** Defines a search space with serial adapters, parallel adapters, and prefix tuning, using high-dimensional Bayesian optimization for effective NAS. Both NOAH and AUTOPEFT show NAS's potential in optimizing PEFT configurations across various tasks.

### Memory-Efficient PEFT Methods
Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) demands substantial training memory due to their immense size. Although many parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the number of parameters, they still incur significant memory overhead during training because gradient computation and backpropagation remain necessary. For instance, popular PEFT techniques like adapters and LoRA only reduce memory usage to about 70% compared to full model fine-tuning. Memory efficiency is a crucial factor that cannot be overlooked.

To enhance memory efficiency, various techniques have been developed to minimize the need for caching gradients for the entire LLM during fine-tuning, thereby reducing memory usage. Notable examples include:

#### 1. Side-Tuning and Ladder-Side Tuning (LST)

- **Side-Tuning** introduces a learnable network branch parallel to the backbone model. By confining backpropagation to this parallel branch, the need to store gradient information for the main model's weights is eliminated, significantly reducing memory requirements.
- **Ladder-Side Tuning (LST)** further refines this approach by adding a ladder structure where fine-tuning occurs exclusively within the additional branches, bypassing the main model’s gradient storage needs.

#### 2. Res-Tuning and Res-Tuning-Bypass

- **Res-Tuning** separates the PEFT tuners (e.g., prompt tuning, adapters) from the backbone model, allowing independent fine-tuning of these modules.
- **Res-Tuning-Bypass** enhances this by creating a bypass network in parallel with the backbone model, removing the data flow from the decoupled tuners to the backbone. This eliminates the requirement for gradient caching within the backbone model during backpropagation.

---
#### 3. Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT)

- MEFT is inspired by reversible models, which do not require caching intermediate activations during the forward pass. Instead, these activations are recalculated from the final output during backpropagation.
- MEFT transforms an LLM into its reversible counterpart without additional pre-training. This involves careful initialization of new parameters to maintain the pre-trained model’s performance, ensuring effective fine-tuning.
- MEFT introduces three methods to significantly reduce memory demands for storing activations, achieving performance comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods.

#### 4. LoRA-FA (LoRA with Frozen Activations)

- Addresses the high activation memory consumption in LoRA fine-tuning. Traditional LoRA requires large input activations to be stored during the forward pass for gradient computation.
- LoRA-FA freezes both the pre-trained weights and the projection-down weights, updating only the projection-up weights. This reduces the need to store input activations, as intermediate activations are sufficient for gradient computation, significantly lowering memory usage.

#### 5. HyperTuning

- Employs a HyperModel to generate PEFT parameters using only a few shot examples, avoiding extensive gradient-based optimization directly on larger models.
- This method achieves results comparable to full model fine-tuning while substantially reducing memory usage.

#### 6. PEFT Plug-in

- Trains PEFT modules on smaller language models first, which is more memory-efficient.
- These trained modules are then integrated into LLMs during inference, circumventing the necessity for gradient-based optimization on larger models, resulting in significant memory savings.

#### 7. MeZO (Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Optimizer)

- Fine-tunes LLMs through forward passes only, using a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimator.
- Implements an in-place solution for the ZO gradient estimator, reducing memory consumption during inference.
- MeZO enables efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU with 80GB of memory, maintaining performance comparable to traditional backpropagation-based fine-tuning methods.

#### 8. QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)

- QLoRA extends the principles of LoRA by introducing quantization techniques to further reduce memory usage.
- By quantizing the activation data, QLoRA reduces the memory footprint required to store activations during fine-tuning.
- This method leverages lower precision data representations while preserving fine-tuning performance, making it highly efficient in memory-constrained environments.

These memory-efficient PEFT methods are crucial advancements in optimizing the fine-tuning process for large language models, addressing the challenge of high memory consumption while maintaining or even improving performance metrics.

## Alignment-Based Fine-Tuning

Alignment-based fine-tuning is the process of adjusting a large language model (LLM) to ensure its behavior aligns with specific goals, such as ethical guidelines, user preferences, and performance standards. The aim is to create models that generate outputs not only based on statistical accuracy but also in accordance with desired ethical, safety, and user-specific criteria.

### Types of Alignment Methods

- **RLHF**: Enhancing Language Models with Human Feedback
- **RLAIF**: Leveraging AI Feedback for Training

--- 

### RLHF: Enhancing Language Models with Human Feedback

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful technique that significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) alone. RLHF leverages human feedback to refine and optimize the model’s responses, ensuring they align better with human preferences and expectations. While SFT trains the model to generate plausible responses based on demonstration data, RLHF provides a more nuanced training signal by using a reward model to score and rank these responses.

#### The Value of Human Feedback

- Human feedback excels in situations where human intuitions are complex and difficult to formalize.
- Dialogues are flexible, with many plausible responses for any given prompt, each varying in quality.

#### Limitations of Demonstration Data

- Demonstration data can show which responses are plausible but not how good or bad each response is.
- RLHF fills this gap by using a scoring function to evaluate response quality.

#### The RLHF Process

##### Training the Reward Model (RM)

- **Purpose**: The RM scores pairs of (prompt, response) based on their quality.
- **Data Collection**: Gather comparison data where labelers decide which of two responses to the same prompt is better.
- **Objective**: Maximize the score difference between winning and losing responses.

##### Optimizing the LLM

- **Goal**: Train the LLM to generate responses that maximize the RM’s scores.
- **Method**: Use reinforcement learning algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

##### Mathematical Framework

- Data Format: (prompt, winning_response, losing_response)
- $s_w = r_{\theta}(x, y_w)$: Reward score for the winning response
- $s_l = r_{\theta}(x, y_l)$: Reward score for the losing response

##### Loss Function

$$\text{Loss} = -\log(\sigma(s_w - s_l))$$

This function encourages the RM to give higher scores to winning responses.

##### Challenges and Solutions in Training the RM

- Achieving consistent scoring among different labelers is challenging.
- Use comparison data instead of absolute scores for easier and more reliable labeling.

- Starting RM training with an SFT model as the seed improves performance.
- The RM must be at least as powerful as the LLM it scores.

##### Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning

- Ensure the RL-tuned model does not deviate too far from the SFT model.
- Use KL divergence to penalize responses that differ significantly from the SFT model’s outputs.

##### Addressing Hallucination

- Hallucination occurs when the model generates incorrect or fabricated information.
- Two hypotheses explain hallucination:
  - Lack of causal understanding by the LLM.
  - Mismatch between the LLM's knowledge and the labeler's knowledge.

- Verify sources to ensure accuracy.
- Develop better reward functions that penalize hallucinations.

##### Effectiveness of RLHF

- RLHF enhances the overall performance and is generally preferred by human evaluators.
- It refines responses based on human feedback and comparisons, improving the model’s ability to generate high-quality, contextually appropriate responses.

- **Fine-tuning SL-CAI Model**:
  - SL-CAI model is fine-tuned using the harmlessness dataset.
  
- **Training Preference Model**:
  - PM is trained using data from the fine-tuned SL-CAI model.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO**:
  - PPO algorithms adjust the SL-CAI model's policy based on PM evaluations.

#### Advantages of RLAIF

- **Bias Reduction**: AI-generated feedback reduces biases inherent in human datasets.
- **Scalability**: Efficient data generation by AI agents enhances scalability.
- **Ethical and Safe Models**: Adherence to Constitutional AI principles ensures ethical model behavior.
- **Performance Improvement**: Iterative fine-tuning and RL enhance model performance and stability.

### Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a novel and efficient method for training language models directly from human preferences. DPO simplifies the training process by optimizing the log-likelihood difference between preferred and non-preferred outputs, bypassing the need for complex reward modeling. This section provides a detailed and structured overview of DPO, including its formulation, advantages, experimental evaluation, and comparative analysis.

#### Formulation of DPO

DPO aims to fine-tune a language model policy $\pi_\theta$ to generate outputs $y_w$ that are preferred over outputs $y_l$, given an input $x$. The optimization objective is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\_{(x, y\_w, y\_l) \sim D} \left[ \log \pi\_\theta(y\_w \mid x) - \log \pi\_\theta(y\_l \mid x) \right]$$
Where:
- $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ is the loss function.
- $(x, y_w, y_l) \in D$ represents data samples where $y_w$ is the preferred output and $y_l$ is the less preferred output.
- $\pi_\theta$ is the policy parameterized by $\theta$.

This formulation directly optimizes the difference in log-likelihoods between preferred and non-preferred outputs, making DPO a straightforward and effective approach.

#### Advantages of DPO

DPO offers several key advantages over traditional RLHF methods:

1. **Simplicity**: DPO eliminates the need for intermediate reward modeling, directly optimizing the policy based on preference data.
2. **Efficiency**: Direct optimization of the log-likelihood difference allows for faster convergence and reduced computational overhead.
3. **Robustness**: DPO is less sensitive to hyperparameter settings, making it easier to implement and tune across different tasks.
4. **Performance**: Empirical results demonstrate that DPO achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art RLHF methods with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

### Identity Preference Optimization (IPO)

**Identity Preference Optimization (IPO)** is a technique to improve the alignment of language models with human preferences. It builds upon **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** by addressing DPO's shortcomings, such as overconfidence and policy degeneration, through identity-based regularization.

#### Motivation

While **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** is effective, it often results in:
- **Overconfident Reward Assignments**: Assigning excessively high rewards can lead to instability.
- **Degenerate Policies**: Models can collapse, assigning near-zero probabilities to preferred responses.

**Identity Preference Optimization (IPO)** aims to mitigate these issues by incorporating a regularization term that respects the identity of preference data.

#### Core Concept

IPO enhances DPO by adding an **identity-based regularization term** to the optimization objective. This regularization helps to:
- Prevent overconfidence in reward assignments.
- Maintain stable and well-behaved policies during optimization.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Collect Preference Data:**
   - Gather preference annotations where each input prompt $x$ has a corresponding preferred response $y_w$ and a non-preferred response $y_\ell$.

2. **Introduce Regularization:**
   - Add an identity-based regularization term to the objective function, as a smoothing mechanism to reduce overconfidence.

3. **Formulate the Objective Function:**
   - Define the IPO objective function as:

     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{ipo}}(\pi_\theta; \mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}}) = \mathbb{E}_{(y_w, y_\ell, x) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}}} \left[ - \log \sigma \left( \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w)}{\pi_\theta(y_\ell)} \frac{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_\ell)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_w)} \right) \right] + \lambda \mathcal{R}(\pi_\theta)$$

     Where:
     - $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
     - $\mathcal{R}(\pi_\theta)$ is the regularization term.
     - $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the regularization strength.

4. **Train the Model:**
   - Use the modified objective function to train the language model, ensuring robust and stable policies.

#### Benefits of IPO

1. **Enhanced Robustness:**
   - The regularization term prevents the model from becoming overly confident, ensuring reliable policies.

2. **Improved Stability:**
   - Regularization maintains stability, preventing policy degeneration.

3. **Better Generalization:**
   - By avoiding overfitting, IPO improves the model's ability to handle new and unseen prompts.

KTO leverages the Kahneman-Tversky model to optimize model utility directly using binary desirability signals. Key components include:

- **Implicit Reward**: Derived from the RLHF objective, ensuring alignment with human utility.
- **Reference Point**: Represents expected rewards under optimal policies across input-output pairs.

The KTO loss function is defined as:

$$L_{\text{KTO}}(\pi_\theta, \pi_{\text{ref}}) = E_{x,y \sim D}[w(y)(1 - v_{\text{KTO}}(x,y; \beta))]$$

Where:
$$r_{\text{KTO}}(x,y) = \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y|x)}$$
$$z_{\text{ref}} = E_{x' \sim D}[\beta \text{KL}(\pi_\theta(y'|x') \parallel \pi_{\text{ref}}(y'|x'))]$$
$$\sigma(r_{\text{KTO}}(x, y) - z_{\text{ref}})$$ for desirable outputs.
$$\sigma(z_{\text{ref}} - r_{\text{KTO}}(x, y))$$ for undesirable outputs.
$$w(y)$$ weights losses based on desirability ($\lambda_D$ for desirable, $\lambda_U$ for undesirable).

### Implementation Details

KTO estimates the KL divergence term practically by comparing outputs from unrelated inputs within a batch, ensuring training stability without back-propagating through the KL term.

### Experimental Results
